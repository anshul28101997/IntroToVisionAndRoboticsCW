How to run image1.py and image2.py in parallel?
Do we have to run in paralell?
How about this:

1. Run the infinite loop in image1.py for.. say 10 seconds, and on every iteration save the 'centers1' to a global variable (append to a list, on every iteration we append a new 'center'), and at the end of the 10 seconds, write 'centers2' to a file c1.npy.

2. Repeat 1. for image2.py, write 'centers2' to a file c2.npy.

THE STARTING POINT OF THE IMAGES MUST BE THE SAME FOR THIS TO WORK.

Now process the centers so that they have the same size, removing any extra elements from the list. Make them 3D using the function available. Save the 3D coordinates and plot them as a lineplot.
